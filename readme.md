#Nothing app:

This is basically a 'nothing' app. Designed solely to get me up to speed with react, ndoe, npm, mocha, q, and express. That should be enough technologies to have a good understanding of isomorphic apps with promises, built with TDD, and using the new-standard of react-router style server routing.

I really just want a single-page app that does very litle, and passes about JSON data asynchronously running on a heroku box to prove that I know _just what the fuck_

*Here we go!*
